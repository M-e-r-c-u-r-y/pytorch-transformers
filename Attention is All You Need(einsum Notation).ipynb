Instead it produces a sequence of context vectors, $Z = (z_1, ... , z_n)$. So, if our input sequence was 5 tokens long we would have $Z = (z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4, z_5)$. We call these vectors as context vectors as they have seen all tokens at all positions within the input sequence. The entire sequence of context vector will be fed into the decoder so that it can choose what to pay attention to while performing the translation task.\n","\n","![](https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-seq2seq/blob/master/assets/transformer-encoder.png?raw=1)\n","\n","First, the tokens are passed through a standard embedding layer. Next, as the model has no recurrent it has no idea about the order of the tokens within the sequence. We solve this by using a second embedding layer called a *positional embedding layer*. This is a standard embedding layer where the input is not the token itself but the position of the token within the sequence, starting with the first token, the `<sos>` (start of sequence) token, in position 0. The position embedding has a \"vocabulary\" size of 100, which means our model can accept sentences up to 100 tokens long. This can be increased if we want to handle longer sentences.\n","\n","The original Transformer implementation from the Attention is All You Need paper does not learn positional embeddings. Instead it uses a fixed static embedding. Modern Transformer architectures, like BERT, use positional embeddings instead, hence we have decided to use them in these tutorials. Check out [this](http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html#positional-encoding) section to read more about the positional embeddings used in the original Transformer model.\n","\n","Next, the token and positional embeddings are elementwise summed together to get a vector which contains information about the token and also its position with in the sequence. However, before they are summed, the token embeddings are multiplied by a scaling factor which is $\\sqrt{d_{model}}$, where $d_{model}$ is the hidden dimension size, `hid_dim`. This supposedly reduces variance in the embeddings and the model is difficult to train reliably without this scaling factor. Dropout is then applied to the combined embeddings.\n","\n","The combined embeddings are then passed through $N$ *encoder layers* to get $Z$, which is then output and can be used by the decoder.\n","\n","The source mask, `src_mask`, is simply the same shape as the source sentence but has a value of 1 when the token in the source sentence is not a `<pad>` token and 0 when it is a `<pad>` token. This is used in the encoder layers to mask the multi-head attention mechanisms, which are used to calculate and apply attention over the source sentence, so the model does not pay attention to `<pad>` tokens, which contain no useful information."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab_type":"code","id":"dvfmbG38V6-V","colab":{}},"source":["class Encoder(nn.Module):\n","    def __init__(self, \n","                 input_dim, \n","                 hid_dim, \n","                 n_layers, \n","                 n_heads, \n","                 pf_dim, \n","                 encoder_layer, \n","                 multi_head_attention_layer, \n","                 positionwise_feedforward_layer, \n","                 dropout, \n","                 device,\n","                 max_length = 100):\n","        super().__init__()\n","\n","        self.device = device\n","        \n","        self.tok_embedding = nn.Embedding(input_dim, hid_dim)\n","        self.pos_embedding = nn.Embedding(max_length, hid_dim)\n","        \n","        self.layers = nn.ModuleList([encoder_layer(hid_dim, \n","                                                   n_heads, \n","                                                   pf_dim, \n","                                                   multi_head_attention_layer, \n","                                                   positionwise_feedforward_layer, \n","                                                   dropout, \n","                                                   device) \n","                                     for _ in range(n_layers)])\n","        \n","        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)\n","        \n","        self.scale = torch.sqrt(torch.FloatTensor([hid_dim])).to(device)\n","        \n","    def forward(self, src, src_mask):\n","        \n","        #src = [batch size, src len]\n","        #src_mask = [batch size, src len]\n","        \n","        batch_size = src.shape[0]\n","        src_len = src.shape[1]\n","        \n","        pos = torch.arange(0, src_len).unsqueeze(0).repeat(batch_size, 1).to(self.device)\n","        \n","        #pos = [batch size, src len]\n","        \n","        src = self.dropout((self.tok_embedding(src) * self.scale) + self.pos_embedding(pos))\n","        \n","        #src = [batch size, src len, hid dim]\n","        \n","        for layer in self.layers:\n","            src = layer(src, src_mask)\n","            \n","        #src = [batch size, src len, hid dim]\n","            \n","        return src"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"-SlpvnYzV6-c"},"source":["### Encoder Layer\n","\n","The encoder layers are where all of the \"meat\" of the encoder is contained.
